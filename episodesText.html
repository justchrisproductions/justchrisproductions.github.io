			<p class="gridParag">Join Chris this week as he covers how he spent his Thanksgiving Holiday, which included a wide variety of food alongside his closest friends and family members in addition to covering the unpredictable outlook of electric vehicle maker, Tesla. Though it may seem like things have been going well for this company, CEO Elon Musk makes it a tad challenging for not only investors, but market-shorters to follow the trend. Does Tesla have a bright future or are they destined to hit rock bottom? Tune in and make the decision for yourself...</p>
