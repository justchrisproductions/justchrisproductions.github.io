A hot take on a new perspective hosted by Chris, who dives into life feet first and shares his thoughts on his world and the world around him. Consisting of the informal dialogue, the podcast covers the large, yet mere important topics that come to the mind of the host. Each episode, posted weekly, will take on new discussion based on the previous week's experiences.
