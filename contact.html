		<h1>Welcome to Just Chris</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the first episode of Just Chris, a podcast based entirely around random thoughts that cross my mind. Given it being the first episode, I am still learning and experimenting with audio and will only improve from here. In the mean time, enjoy the best episode yet ;)<br>Please do your best to make it through the rough audio, improvements are to come! Feel free to follow me on Youtube, SoundCloud, my hosting website, and add me on Xbox Live.... more social media to be plugged in future episodes.<br>Buzzsprout SoundCloud Youtube Xbox Live: BhrisBarter1</p>
